                                <img src="img/sarahThumb.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Katie" />

Katie’s personal goal has been “be more awesome”, since someone asked for her New Year Resolutions many years ago. She is constantly striving for more awesomeness by always being game to try new things and always being up for an adventure. Katie is a Washington native that grew up 40 minutes north of Seattle. She attended the University of Washington for both her undergraduate and graduate degree. While still an undergrad, she finagled her way into a study abroad in Rome, twice. This cemented her love of travel and realization that at some point in the future she was going to need a partner in crime to tag along on all her travel adventures. She loves Seattle, America, and Justin.</p>

                                <img src="img/bradThumb.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Justin" />
Justin grew up in the town of Fonthill, just 20 minutes outside of Niagara Falls. Justin started playing the piano at the age of four and he continues playing to this day. The neighbours will often hear Justin practicing on Sunday afternoons – nobody has complained yet! Justin is a Waterloo grad. Waterloo’s internship program brought him to Seattle twice before graduation. He accepted a job offer from Amazon and officially moved across the border in 2009. He is always game for Katie’s adventures big or small. He loves Seattle, Canada, and Katie.</p>

<p>The Internet.</p> 

<p>Oh? Yeah ok. Maybe a little more background? Justin found Katie through OKCupid. Katie likes awesome things (see above). Her profile said so. Justin suggested to her an awesome thing: learning to juggle! Katie thought that opening an email with juggling was possibly the dorkiest pick up line she had ever heard. But oh so very endearing. She responded and they met. The first date went well and Katie accepted an invitation to the second Mariner’s game of the year. Her reasoning, the second game price will be half the price of opening day. Justin found Katie’s frugalness VERY endearing. That marathon of a date lasted 9 hours. By the end both were pretty sure that something good was happening. They now have had three years of adventures under their belts and can’t wait for a lifetime more.</p>

<p>P.S. Katie already knew how to juggle. She still calls it the dorkiest pick up line ever. It just happened to work. Once.</p>

                            <h2>THE ENGAGEMENT</h2>
                            <p>
In May, Katie turned 30 and in June, she completed her Master’s degree. She decreed that there was going to be a BIG vacation to celebrate. Justin speaks French. Katie likes baguettes, and wine. They decided to go to France to celebrate. After three days of trying to sight see all of Paris, they headed to Versailles. Katie wondered why Justin hadn’t taken off his jacket except to sleep the past four days. She just assumed he was very nervous about someone pickpocketing his wallet. That day they walked the entire length of gardens to Marie Antoinette’s Estate. By the time they got there, Katie was looking for a bench to rest her feet and Justin was looking for a bench to propose. They found their bench and then Katie watched Justin get down on one knee. She barely heard the proposal but remembered to say yes when Justin paused. Later than evening, she requested that Justin repeat his proposal and promised to actually listen this time.
